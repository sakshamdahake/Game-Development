Game development using pygame library in python.


This repo consists of two games coded in python using pygame library.
This is just to give you an idea about the pygame library so that you get familiar with it in order to code your very own games!
1)Slither-snake game:
            
            I think you are familiar with this game. Everyone must have played this in there childhood. I used to love this game and a fair warning from me, it is adictive XD.
            Yeah, the snake who eats apples and gets long enough for you to manage it moving around the screen to eat more. The fun thing is this snake never gettired of eating.
            HAVE FUN!
2)Pong:
             Pong was the first game developed by Atari. Well it is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis.
             The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen.
             They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side.
             Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other. Well actually I've not developped this one completly so that you can develop it after getting to know the pygame library.
